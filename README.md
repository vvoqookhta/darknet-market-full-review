## Vendor Perspective: Growing on Nexus

As a vendor, my top priorities are **security** and **fair rules.** Nexus understands vendors’ needs while protecting buyers:

- **Verified reviews:** Every deal leaves a trace, so scammers are ousted quickly.
- **BTC & Monero payments:** Ensures both privacy and flexibility.
- **Low commission:** More of my earnings come back to me.
- Vendor onboarding is straightforward, but they enforce strong anti-fraud checks, which means less competition from “fly by night” fakes.
